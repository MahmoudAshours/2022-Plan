# Introduction

Fortunately , 3/4 of the 2021 plan repository was finished. âœ… 
It's time for a new challenge , although I face alot of problems & difficulties this year.
Coding practically this year won't be easy until 1 / 12 / 2022.
Why? because I'm currently serving in the military..

This year will be mainly studying and practicing the theoretical computing , also revision on the last 4 years of faculty of computer and informatics. 
This year will be mainly focusing on reading Technical books & different technical topics , and also dow my best in practicing when the opportunity comes!

I'm free and happy to receive feedbacks , pull requests or even addition in more different topics!
