# :wave: Hey There!


# Introduction

Fortunately , 3/4 of the 2021 plan repository was finished. âœ… 
It's time for a new challenge , although I face alot of problems & difficulties this year.
Coding practically this year won't be easy until 1 / 12 / 2022.
Why? because I'm currently serving in the military..

This year will be mainly studying and practicing the theoretical computing , also revision on the last 4 years of faculty of computer and informatics. 
This year will be mainly focusing on reading Technical books & different technical topics , and also dow my best in practicing when the opportunity comes!

I'm free and happy to receive feedbacks , pull requests or even addition in more different topics!

## DOMIs

Domi or ( Documents in military) is a personal documents hosted in Google docs , it averages 150 - 200 pages which contains different topics , articles , researches
also different linkedin and Facebook posts to read in military.

- Total DOMIs number will be roughly 17 DOMI.

- [First domi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fJRm22yTQUKgwth0Zv7iqo-F9N_n6JrIdVhLz_2X_bQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Open data structures

Open Data Structures covers the implementation and analysis of data structures for sequences (lists), queues, priority queues, unordered dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, and graphs.
Data structures presented in the book include stacks, queues, deques, and lists implemented as arrays and linked-lists; space-efficient implementations of lists; skip lists; hash tables and hash codes; binary search trees including treaps, scapegoat trees, and red-black trees; integer searching structures including binary tries, x-fast tries, and y-fast tries; heaps, including implicit binary heaps and randomized meldable heaps; graphs, including adjacency matrix and ajacency list representations; and B-trees.

The data structures in this book are all fast, practical, and have provably good running times. All data structures are rigorously analyzed and implemented in Java and C++. The Java implementations implement the corresponding interfaces in the Java Collections Framework.

I'll be focusing on JAVA implementation , all exercises I solve will be updated and pushed on the repository .
